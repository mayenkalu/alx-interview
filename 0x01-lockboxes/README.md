# Lockboxes

* Lockboxes are secure containers used to protect valuable items or sensitive information.
* They come in different sizes, materials, and security levels. Lockboxes have lock mechanisms, such as keys, combinations, or biometrics, to restrict access.
* They are used in various contexts, including homes, real estate, emergency access, key management, medication storage, and data protection.
* While lockboxes enhance security, they are not completely invulnerable.
* Choosing the right lockbox and following best practices is essential.
