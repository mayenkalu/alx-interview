# N Queens

The "N Queens" problem is a classic puzzle in combinatorial optimization and computer science. The objective of the problem is to place N chess queens on an NÃ—N chessboard in such a way that no two queens threaten each other. In chess, a queen can move horizontally, vertically, or diagonally across the board.

The challenge is to find all possible arrangements of the queens on the board that satisfy the constraint of non-attack, meaning no two queens can be placed in positions where they could attack each other in a single move.

**Key points about the "N Queens" problem:**

1. _Constraints:_ Each row and column should contain exactly one queen, and no two queens should be placed on the same diagonal.

2. _Solutions:_ The problem typically asks for all possible solutions to the N Queens puzzle, not just a single valid arrangement.

3. _Backtracking Algorithm:_ The most common approach to solving the "N Queens" problem is by using a backtracking algorithm. It involves placing queens on the board row by row, and whenever an invalid placement is encountered, the algorithm backtracks to try alternative positions.

4. _Symmetry:_ Due to the symmetry of the board and the nature of the problem, the total number of distinct solutions is often much smaller than the total number of possible permutations.

The "N Queens" problem has fascinated mathematicians and computer scientists for its algorithmic challenges and applications in various domains. It serves as a popular example to illustrate backtracking algorithms and recursion, and it has implications in fields like optimization, graph theory, and constraint satisfaction problems. Solving the "N Queens" problem efficiently for large N values remains an area of research and interest in the field of computer science and combinatorial optimization.
