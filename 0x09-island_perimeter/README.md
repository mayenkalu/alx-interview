# Island Perimeter

An **island's perimeter** refers to the total length of its outer boundary, which encompasses its coastline.

Calculating the perimeter is crucial for various purposes, such as land management, environmental assessments, and disaster preparedness.

It helps determine the length of coastline that needs protection, monitoring, or development planning.

The island's shape, size, and intricacies of its coastline all contribute to the calculation of its perimeter.
