# Making Change

> The given task revolves around determining the optimal way to make change using a set of different coin values.
> The primary objective is to find the minimum number of coins required to reach a specific target total.
> We are provided with a function called `makeChange`, which takes two inputs: a list of coin values and a target total.

The goal is to design an efficient algorithm that can efficiently select the fewest number of coins from the list to meet the target total. This involves considering various coin combinations while taking advantage of the infinite supply of each coin denomination. 

The solution must handle cases where the total is zero or negative, and it should also identify scenarios where it's not feasible to achieve the target total using the available coin values. The key to success here lies in finding a balance between dynamic programming and greedy strategies to optimize the number of coins used.
