# Pascal's Triangle

## Description

Pascal's Triangle is a mathematical triangle named after the French mathematician Blaise Pascal. It is a triangular array of numbers where each number is the sum of the two numbers directly above it. The triangle starts with a single 1 at the top and each subsequent row is constructed by summing adjacent elements from the row above.

Pascal's Triangle has various applications in combinatorial mathematics, probability theory, algebraic identities, and number theory.

This repository contains an implementation of Pascal's Triangle in Python.

## Features

Generates Pascal's Triangle up to a given number of rows.
Prints the triangle in a visually appealing format.

## Tasks To Complete

0 . **Pascal's Triangle**

[0-pascal_triangle.py](0-pascal_triangle.py): contains a function `def pascal_triangle(n):` that returns a list of lists of integers representing the Pascal's triangle of `n`:

+ Returns an empty list if `n <= 0`.

+ You can assume `n` will be always an integer.
